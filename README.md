# .NET Performance Benchmarks Repository

Welcome to our .NET Performance Benchmarks Repository! This project is dedicated to providing comprehensive benchmarks across various .NET operations and implementations. Our goal is to offer insights into performance optimizations and best practices within the .NET ecosystem.

## Repository Structure

- **Benchmarks/**: Contains a series of sub-folders, each dedicated to a specific benchmark. Each sub-folder includes the benchmark code and a README with results.
- **BenchmarksResult/**: Hosts all the benchmark results in different formats (HTML, CSV, MD) for easy access and comparison.
- **EmbeddedResource/** + **Entities/**: Support folders for the project, containing necessary resources and entity definitions used across benchmarks.

## Running the Benchmarks

To run the benchmarks, ensure you have the latest .NET SDK and BenchmarkDotNet library installed. Clone this repository, navigate to the desired benchmark's directory, and execute the benchmarks using the .NET CLI.
